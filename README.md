This is a work in progress by a hobbyist, so I'm probably doing things wrong.


## Oshare
#### Oshare is a Social Media webapp with a focus on privacy, simplicity, and content:

### Privacy 
* No user search – users must share their usernames in real life.
* Users must request and approve friendships.
* User posts are private amongst friends – user must become a Creator to post globally.
* User data is not collected or shared with 3rd parties.
* No advertising.

### Simplicity
* No algorhithm – posts are sorted by date, and searchable by relevance.

### Content
* Creators receive equal treatment.
* No brands or studios – individual creators only.


### Oshare is built on:
* Ruby on Rails
* Devise
* CanCanCan
* ActiveStorage
* Sung Won Cho's has_friendship
* Dana Mulder's simple_rails_messaging_tutorial
